# Drupal Skeleton

## About this project

Drupal Skeleton is an opinionated approach to building new Drupal 7 projects. It is derived from our experience of building, testing, and deploying projects for our clients. It is a work in progress which is reflective of the fact that we are always striving to find better, easier, and more efficient ways of doing our work. It is critical that you bring your own discoveries and insights back to this project.

When you initiate a new project with Drupal Skeleton, you’ll be cloning the repository and blowing away the git history, and from that point the installation is managed as a stand-alone unit. If you find new tools or potential improvements, please do contribute them back to Drupal Skeleton. It’s a highly collaborative project, and you’re welcome to make it even better with your pull requests.

## Requirements

* [virtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) >= 4.3.x
* [vagrant](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/) >= 1.7.x
* [vagrant-hostmanager](https://github.com/smdahlen/vagrant-hostmanager)
  * Install with: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager`
* [vagrant-auto_network](https://github.com/oscar-stack/vagrant-auto_network) `vagrant plugin install vagrant-auto_network`

If you have been running a previous version of Vagrant you may need to do: `vagrant plugin update` to ensure that you can install the plugins.

## Getting Started Using the Skeleton

1. Clone this repo and blow away its `.git`.
2. Name your project in the `Vagrantfile` (line 6).
3. Make `README.dist.md` your own project's `README.md`.
4. Run `vagrant up` and if all went well, you can visit `YOURPROJECT.local` in your brower of choice.
5. Rename all the things (see some bash hints below, which can be run inside your project root in vagrant).

Rename things the bash way:

```
rename "s/skeleton/YOURPROJECT/" *.*
sed -i 's/skeleton/YOURPROJECT/g' *.*
sed -i -- 's/skeleton/YOURPROJECT/g' **/*
```

## Anatomy of Drupal Skeleton

### Vagrant

**Managed with** one file: ``Vagrantfile``

**Customize by** naming your project

### Testing

**Managed with**

* ``behat.yml``
* ``circle.yml``
* ``features``

**Customize by**

* Editing ``behat.yml``
* make your build explicit in ``circle.yml``
* add your acceptance testing inside ``features``

### Composer

**Manage with**

* ``composer.json``

**Customize by**

* Adding project dependencies.

NOTE: After successful `composer update` or `composer install`, `bin/wrapper` is called to create Drupal's `settings.php` file, and `bin/rootcanal` is called to build the Drupal root at `www`.

### Managing Dependencies

**Manage with**

* ``skeleton.info``
* ``skeleton.module`` (only necessary because Drupal says it is)
* ``env.dist``

**Customize by**

* specifying your project's dependencies inside the ``.info``
* distinguish dev requirements and prod by adding a separate module for just dev
* use the `env.dist` to specify which of these modules should be enabled

NOTE: In the `Vagrantfile`, the `env.dist` is copied to `.env`. It is this file that is sourced during the build; `.env` should not be on version control, since your dev environment will be different than prod.

### Build

**Manage with**

* ``build/install.sh``
* ``build/update.sh``
* ``build/common.sh``
* ``build/scripts``

**Customize by**

* Drupal is initialized with `install.sh` using the minimal profile.
* After the install, a series of commands are run in `update.sh` to actually configure Drupal.
* Variables are set by `update.sh`, which runs the scripts inside `scripts`.
